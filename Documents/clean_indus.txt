Gulab Jamun

Preparation Time: 10 minutes
Cooking Time: 40 minutes
Servings: 10

Ingredients:
Khoya (Firmly Packed) .................. 100 grams
Refined Flour .......................... 1 tbsp
Baking Soda ............................ 1/2 tsp
Sugar ................................... 2 cups
Water ................................... 2 cups
Milk (Mixed with a little water) ...... 2 tbsp
Green Cardamom (Slightly Crushed) .... 4 pieces
Ghee ................................... For frying
Cube of Bread .......................... 1 (for temperature control while frying)

Method:
Mash the khoya using the heel of your palm or the base of a flat bowl until smooth. Mix in the flour and baking soda, kneading into a firm but pliable dough. Wet hands if the dough feels dry.  
Shape the dough into smooth, marble-sized balls (jamuns), either round or oblong. Heat ghee in a karahi, then fry a cube of bread until light brown to lower the temperature of the ghee. Remove the bread and gently add the jamuns, ensuring they do not touch each other.  
Keep the heat low and fry the jamuns until golden-brown all over. Repeat in batches, adjusting the heat as needed.  
For the syrup, mix sugar and water in a pan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then add the milk-water mixture and continue boiling on high without stirring. Skim off any residue from the sides. Cook until syrup slightly thickens. Remove from heat and cool for at least 30 minutes before adding jamuns.
